# What?
- This repo is a copy of https://git.drupalcode.org/project/promote_disable
- Original Drupal module: https://www.drupal.org/project/promote_disable

# Why?
- Official module compatible with D10
- Can't fork modules on git.drupalcode.org
- Maintainer did not validate D10 patch
- Can't require the module and apply the patch lately because of `^9` requirement not met in D10 installation
- I was not aware of that: https://gorannikolovski.com/blog/how-to-upgrade-drupal-9-to-10#how-to-install-modules

# Modifications:
- Created a new branch `10.x-1.x`
- Bumped version `^10` into `promote_disable.info.yaml`
- Tagged a new release `2.0.1`

# How to install?
