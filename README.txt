Promote Disable
_______________

This simple module allows a user to select node types on which they 
would like to disable the "Promote to front page" option. Although a 
user can set this option on the content type configuration page, this 
does not stop a content author from reselecting the option on a node 
by node basis. Promote Disable actually disables the checkbox so that 
it can't be clicked.

This module is also useful when programmatically creating nodes, such 
as when using the Devel module. Promote Disable stops nodes from being 
programmatically promoted to the front page.


Installation
------------

Install as normal (see http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes).
Once installed and enabled go to <yoursite>/admin/config/content/promote_disable
and select the node types you would like Promote Disable to apply
to. No more configuration is needed.
